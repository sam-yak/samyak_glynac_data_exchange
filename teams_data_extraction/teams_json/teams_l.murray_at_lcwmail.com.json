    "message": "I have a couple questions for you regarding LCW\u2019s train-the trainer program. Would Voya need to pay for the site license and the training sessions? Yes, the Train-the-Trainer program consist of two components the site license and the TTT sessions. The site licenses are priced as follows: - Content for 1-2 hr courses \u200b- $35,000 per course - Content for 3-8 hr courses \u200b- $60,000 per course Then the cost of the TTT training session is additional. See below for details on 1 vs 2 day TTT training sessions. NOTE - Site licenses are not currently available for some courses including LCW Cultural Immersions and select Cultural Competence Workshops-but if you have great interest in those, we can talk about doing those if the total spend is large enough (i.e. over $1.5m) What is the difference between the one & two day sessions? Would that be a decision we make on which one we go with? Is there a maximum number of trainers we can have trained for the fee? The difference between the one & two day sessions is based on the length of the content. Details and investment amounts: - One Day TTT Program (for 1-2 hr courses) - $20,000 - INCLUDES: Live Course Delivery + Walkthrough of each piece of content + Teachbacks - Two Day TTT Program (for 3-8 hr courses) - $40,000 - INCLUDES: Day 1: Live Course Delivery + Walkthrough of each piece of content\u200b with Q&A and Day 2 : Teachbacks, practice, and Q&A - LCW can accom m odate up to 10 candidate trainers in each session. Did you provide me with a cost for our Unconscious Bias training (4 hour session)? An off-the-shelf 4-hour session with two facilitators delivering LCW\u2019s UB content is $15,000. Additional Workshop Customizations to adapt content to client\u2019s specific audience (e.g., industry, region, country, or global) or learning objectives are available. When being designed for a firm wide rollout, the typical cost is about $20k for the customization of a \u2018global\u2019 version. Additional customizations for specific world regions or parts of the business range are typically starting at $3,000",
