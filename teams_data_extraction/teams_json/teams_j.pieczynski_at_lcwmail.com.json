    "message": "Moving this meeting so Alisa can join us. Please read below before our next meeting! Add questions or thought to consider before the meeting to the thread below. Stemming from a conversation with Alisa, I'd like to ask that before we talk through our standing questions for this meeting, we first work through how we can make the process we go through each month something that goes out each quarter in anticipation of clients' needs. I'm hoping we can discuss what it would look like for us to proactively assemble content (in a bundle or simply as it is relevant to upcoming events/heritage months/awareness months) that we can get in front of clients on a quarterly basis. This would build upon our current idea of \"bundling,\" but would create a standardized time to push out this content - every quarter we'd push out a communication with the items we want to highlight for the quarter after that (example: in Q3 we send out the content we want to highlight for Q4). We would curate this quarterly content to serve these purposes: - Highlight programs that are timely to the next quarter's needs (i.e. highlighting LGBTQ+ centered content in Q1, Holiday Module in Q3, etc.) - Bring attention to newly created programs or reimagined/underutilized programs we want clients to know about - Provide solutions that help address current trends or issues within a global context or specific to the DEI community This would require the following from the each of us (similar to how we currently operate): - RP: help curate the content and apply our library to upcoming needs & identify current trends we can curate content to address - JP: package the content together into a sharable piece of collateral and craft the message - LQ: get the collateral in front of clients each quarter with their respective SOW owner & get this content in front of prospective clients Potencial process for operationalizing this each quarter: - Topic of each meeting of the quarter: - 1st meeting of the quarter (Identifying What to Solve for Next): - What everyone will bring to the meeting: - JP comes with awareness months/heritage months we can program to - RP comes with industry trends/issues we can address - LQ comes with client feedback/trends/needs to solve for - Goal: leave the meeting having identified what we will solve for in next quarter's communication - 2nd meeting of the quarter (Content Selection): - What everyone will bring to the meeting: - JP comes with an idea of how to layout/structure the collateral - RP comes with suggested programing to fit what we are addressing in next quarter's communication - LQ comes with feedback on how the current quarter's outreach is going - Goal: leave the meeting having identified the specific LCW programs/content that will be highlighted in - 3rd meeting of the quarter (Collateral/Message Finalization): - What everyone will bring to the meeting: - JP comes with the collateral/communication that will be shared next quarter (sent to LQ and RP one week ahead of this meeting for review) - RP and LQ come ready with feedback/suggested edits to the collateral/communication that will be shared next quarter - Goal: leave the meeting having identified the final changes needed to complete the final communication Questions we can discuss together during next week\u2019s meeting: - Basically, this idea changes our current strategy by putting a quarterly outlook on what we highlight for clients. Is that realistic? Will it work to look one quarter ahead? - What's the best way to get this content in front of clients on a quarterly basis? - And how do we track that this outreach so we can document success (Compass)? - What is the collateral that is shared (Is it a template plain text email?, Is it a template HTML email? Is it a landing page on the website?, etc.) - Reviewing my suggested process for going about this each quarter... - Does this process seem realistic? - What would you change about this process? I know this was a lot - let me know if you'd like to talk this through before our group conversation next week. I'm looking forward to pressure testing this with you all and getting your feedback on how we can make this workable and worthwhile! Thanks! Jake I'm also putting this in our Teams channel so you can write questions there ahead of our meeting",
