There are many observances in the United States in December, including religious holidays, international days, and other holidays: - Christmas : A Christian holiday that celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ /December 25 2024 - Hanukkah : An eight-day Jewish holiday that celebrates the rededication of the Holy Temple Dec 25,2024 to Jan 02,2025 - Kwanzaa : A holiday that is commonly celebrated in the United States and around the world by many now Dec 26 2024-Jan 01,2025 - World AIDS Day : An international day to show support for people living with HIV, honor those who have died from AIDS-related illnesses, and fight against HIV - International Day for the Abolition of Slavery : An international day to raise awareness of modern slavery and the human rights violations it causes December 02,2024 - International Day of Persons with Disabilities : An international day to create accessible and inclusive societies for people with disabilities December 03.2024 - Feast of the Holy Family : A Catholic liturgical celebration that honors Jesus, his mother, and St. Joseph December 29,2024 - Watch Night : A Christian day for reflection, confession, prayer, and resolution for the year ahead but also Watch Night or \u201cFreedom's Eve,\u201d when African Americans watched and waited for the news of Freedom.

    "message": "DID YOU KNOW???? November is National Gratitude Month: It started in 2015, thanks to Stacey Grewal, an author and inspirational speaker who wanted a dedicated time to focus on gratitude, which led to the month-long celebration every November. This month encourages people to express thanks and appreciate the positives in their lives, fostering a culture of gratitude that can lead to a happier and more fulfilling life. Grewal\u2019s initiative quickly gained traction, with communities and organizations adopting various ways to participate. Activities like gratitude journaling, thank-you notes, and public gratitude walls became popular methods to engage people in the spirit of thankfulness. These practices help individuals recognize and appreciate the good in their daily lives, promoting mental and emotional well-being. Over the years, National Gratitude Month has grown in popularity, incorporating new traditions and activities. Social media campaigns, workshops, and community events now play a significant role in spreading the message of gratitude. This month-long celebration continues to evolve, encouraging people to make gratitude a regular part of their lives, leading to stronger relationships and a more positive outlook. This month-long celebration also reminds us to acknowledge and appreciate the contributions of others. It can strengthen bonds within families, friendships, and communities. By making gratitude a daily habit, people can create a more empathetic and connected world, enhancing overall well-being for everyone involved.",

Armistice Day (which coincides with Remembrance Day and Veterans Day, public holidays) is commemorated every year on 11 November to mark the Armistice of 11 November 1918 signed between the Allies of World War I and the German Empire at Compi\u00e8gne, France, for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front of World War I, which took effect at eleven o'clock in the morning, the \"eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\" of 1918. I had a great weekend full of hugs and great conversations locally and globally. As have family in Europe who have served in several wars including WWI, connecting with family made me realize what the word FIGHT & FREEDOM really mean BUT also as we spoke about the US elections\u2019 results, the conversation came to express that CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES is something the USA could embrace for the good of ALL AMERICANS, so we could really call ourselves UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . Once again, understanding culture through global traditions, holidays etc. gives us a well needed boost of cultural competence.",

    "message": "How do we narrate historical events? And from whose perspective? One of the core missions of intercultural education is to increase the awareness about \u201cColonial\u201d perspective and words we often use without even awareness. Narratives have shaped our understanding of history and too often, we use terms without realizing their impact, perpetuating a Eurocentric view. Taking in consideration diverse cultural perspectives and showing respect for cultural differences mean also starting a process of decolonization of our mindset of our use of language. For many, this date does not symbolize a discovery but rather the beginning of a painful history of colonization, exploitation, and cultural loss. In Argentina, October 12th is celebrated as D\u00eda del Respeto a la Diversidad Cultural (Day of Respect for Cultural Diversity), rather than focusing on the \u201cdiscovery\u201d narrative. It\u2019s a day to honour cultural differences and promote reflection on our shared histories. Some regions informally call it D\u00eda de la Amistad.
