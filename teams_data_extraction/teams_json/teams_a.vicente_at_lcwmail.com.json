    "message": "Lesson 3 is also now posted in the \"Files\" tab. Special notes: Critical Background for the LCW Team: The 4 mini-videos leveraged in this lesson are brand new, and have just recently been added to the LCW solutions deck. For almost everyone at LCW, this lesson is their first opportunity to view these videos. T he idea for them came in the early days of COVID-19 and before the murder of George Floyd, when LCW was faced with a dramatic drop in contracts and revenue. As organizations responded to the epidemic by scaling back their training and spending, LCW looked inward at that moment to seize the new found \u2018down time\u2019 to innovate new product ideas, among them the \u201cmini-video rapid design\u201d concept of: (a) building bite-sized videos quickly and relatively cheaply by putting to work the operation team\u2019s skillsets for video production alongside the consulting team\u2019s content knowledge, (b) developing the content in a collaborative process where several LCW consultants would work together on script-writing and iterations to bring the videos to life in the best way for our clients. Shortly after this plan was hatched, the murder of George Floyd led to such a dramatic spike in everyone\u2019s workload that no one had time to fully execute on the multi-person, collaborative nature of these initial plans. Instead, a new \u2018proof of concept\u2019 plan emerged; these 4 mini-videos would be produced as a side project in whatever moments a couple of LCW staff members could carve out. Now that LCW\u2019s staff has grown and the team once again has sufficient bandwidth to innovate, a parallel goal of Lesson 3 is to provide a fresh look at the opportunity these 4 proof of concept mini-videos present. What can/should/will LCW do next? How can LCW build on this proof of concept with new products? What products in this category would most \u2018wow\u2019 LCW clients and deliver on LCW\u2019s value proposition? NOTE: This lesson is also designed with the shorter 4-day work week in mind, and should take you half as much time to complete as previous lessons.",
