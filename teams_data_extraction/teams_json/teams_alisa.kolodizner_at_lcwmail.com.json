    "message": "The Supreme Court Case That Will Fuel the Corporate DEI Debate In 2025 Michelle Travis (https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelletravis/) Professor Michelle Travis covers equitable workplace law and policy. Dec 22, 2024,07:45am EST The U.S. Supreme Court will decide a case in 2025 that could fuel the debate over corporate DEI The U.S. Supreme Court is set to rule on an employment discrimination case in 2025 that could add fuel to the debate over corporate DEI programs\u2014without ever mentioning diversity, equity, and inclusion. Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services involves a \u201creverse discrimination\u201d claim. These claims are brought by members of a majority group alleging discrimination in favor of members of a minority group. Employment law experts explain what\u2019s at stake in the Ames case, and why the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling might be used to challenge corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The Lower Courts\u2019 Rulings in Ames Marlean Ames was hired in 2004 as an employee at a youth services agency, where she was promoted to an administrator position in 2014. Ames applied for a promotion to become a Bureau Chief in 2019. She did not receive that job and was instead demoted. Her employer promoted a gay man to fill her former administrator position. Her employer later selected a gay woman for the Bureau Chief job. Ames is heterosexual. She filed a federal lawsuit against her employer alleging discrimination on the basis of her sexual orientation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII prohibits covered employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Supreme Court held that sexual orientation is also protected under Title VII in the 2020 case of Bostock v. Clayton County . Although sexual orientation is a protected status, the lower courts dismissed Ames\u2019s Title VII lawsuit for insufficient evidence. All employees who file Title VII discrimination claims must meet an initial evidentiary showing for their lawsuit to proceed. Because Ames was claiming reverse discrimination, this initial step required an extra showing of \u201cbackground circumstances to support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.\u201d Ames did not meet the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement. The two employment decision makers who denied Ames a promotion and demoted her were not gay. And there was no evidence that her employer had a pattern of discriminating against heterosexual employees. Ames appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. While five of the federal circuit courts (covering about 20 states) use the extra \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d test for reverse discrimination claims, the other seven federal circuit courts do not. The Supreme Court agreed to take Ames\u2019s case to resolve this conflict. Oral arguments are scheduled for February 26, 2025. A decision is expected by the end of June. What\u2019s at Stake for Corporate DEI Programs Ames is not directly challenging an employer\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion program. Ames is just arguing that her employer individually discriminated against her because she is heterosexual, by selecting gay workers for the two positions she wanted . So what does this case have to do with corporate DEI? The outcome in Ames matters because DEI critics increasingly have been using reverse discrimination claims to challenge DEI initiatives (https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/2023/12/20/dei-reverse-discrimination-lawsuits-increase-woke/71923487007/) . This trend accelerated after the Supreme Court struck down race-based affirmative action in higher education in SFFA v. Harvard College in 2023. America First Legal issued a statement (https://aflegal.org/america-first-legal-puts-woke-corporations-law-firms-and-hospitals-on-notice-all-dei-programs-and-workplace-balancing-based-on-race-national-origin-and-sex-violate-the-law/) after the SFFA decision asserting that \u201call DEI programs\u201d were now \u201cillegal.\u201d America First Legal is led by Stephen Miller, a first-term Trump advisor who is slated to serve as deputy chief of staff and homeland security advisor in Trump\u2019s second term. Legal experts were quick to respond that SFFA did not involve a Title VII discrimination claim, and its ruling does not apply to private sector employers. \u201cThis is politics, folks; don\u2019t mistake it for law,\u201d said Joan C. Williams, law professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, in a 2023 response (https://hbr.org/2023/08/no-scotus-did-not-make-your-companys-dei-programs-illegal) titled, \u201cNo, SCOTUS Did Not Make Your Company\u2019s DEI Programs Illegal.\u201d To date, reverse discrimination claims targeting well-designed corporate DEI programs have been largely unsuccessful. However, if the Supreme Court sides with Ames and strikes down the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement, it may make it easier for employees to meet the initial evidentiary hurdle in reverse discrimination claims in states currently using that test. Lawsuits attempting to challenge DEI may increase as a result. \u201cIt\u2019s a case that people are expecting will open the courthouse doors to more reverse discrimination suits,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, co-chair of Gibson Dunn\u2019s labor and employment practice group, in an email response. Although Ames involves sexual orientation, its decision should apply to reverse discrimination claims involving all Title VII categories, including race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. An uptick in reverse discrimination claims is also predicted by Alyesha Asghar, shareholder and co-chair of Littler\u2019s EEO & Diversity Practice Group, and Julian Wolfson, associate at Littler, in a 2024 bulletin (https://www.littler.com/publication-press/publication/high-court-review-standard-applied-reverse-discrimination-cases?utm_source=elinfonet) on the Ames case. \u201cIf the Supreme Court eliminates the background circumstances requirement, it will be easier for plaintiffs from historically majority communities to pursue reverse discrimination claims,\u201d explained Asghar and Wolfson, at least in the five circuits that currently use this test. \u201cIt is relatively common for employers to rely on that principle to defend against challenges to diversity initiatives under Title VII,\u201d said Asghar and Wolfson. \u201cIf employers in those circuits are no longer able to assert this argument, it will likely become easier for plaintiffs from historically majority communities to assail DEI initiatives.\u201d Just because employees file more reverse discrimination claims challenging corporate DEI programs, however, does not necessarily mean that those claims are more likely to succeed. Many legal experts predict that well-designed DEI programs should remain legal under Title VII, regardless of the outcome in Ames . Well-Designed DEI Programs May Not Face Greater Legal Risk \u201cWhile the Ames case may contribute to an already growing swell of majority group discrimination claims, it should not fundamentally alter the risk profile of these matters,\u201d said Victoria Slade, counsel with Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, and Alysa Mo, associate at DWT, in a 2024 bulletin (https://www.dwt.com/blogs/employment-labor-and-benefits/2024/10/supreme-court-ames-v-ohio-and-dei-implications) on the Ames case. \u201cChanging the test for majority group discrimination claims does not change the law around DEI,\u201d said Slade and Mo. \u201cProperly executed DEI programs are not unlawful, under any application of Title VII.\u201d First, even if the Supreme Court accepts Ames\u2019s position and strikes down the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement in reverse discrimination claims, that would only affect cases in the five federal circuits that currently use this rule. Nothing would change in the seven federal circuits that currently do not require a showing of \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d in reverse discrimination claims. Second, the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement only relates to the threshold evidentiary showing that employees must meet to have their reverse discrimination cases move forward. As with all Title VII claims, employers can still defend the case by showing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision. Schwartz sees a potentially larger impact on reverse discrimination claims challenging DEI programs if the Supreme Court rules for Ames. \u201cI do think many (not all) of those challenges will be successful,\u201d said Schwartz, \u201cbut there is room for a thoughtful, practical, and legally defensible approach to corporate diversity programs.\u201d Advice for Employers on DEI in 2025 Employers can reduce the risk of all discrimination claims by focusing on bias reduction measures and thoughtfully designing their diversity initiatives. \u201cAs always, an employer\u2019s best risk mitigation strategy is to make fair and well-reasoned employment decisions, without regard to the protected classes of the affected employees,\u201d said Slade and Mo. Best practices for bias reduction (https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelletravis/2024/04/18/supreme-court-expands-employer-risk-of-discrimination-claims/) include using objective evaluation criteria, documenting performance-based reasons for managerial decisions, conducting internal audits on diversity outcomes, and educating decision makers about the sources of bias. Employers should focus on designing diversity initiatives that ensure equal employment opportunities by building more inclusive workplaces . \u201cMost corporate DEI programs are aimed at reducing discrimination, which is consistent with the law of Title VII and should be defended on that ground,\u201d said Tristin Green, law professor at Loyola Law School, who responded via email. These initiatives may include workplace training on bias reduction, allyship, and inclusive leadership. Employers may broaden recruiting outreach to attract more diverse candidate pools. And employers may invest in more inclusive employee benefits, such as paid parental leave, childcare, and reproductive and maternal health care. In contrast, using a protected status for a hiring quota, as a tiebreaker criteria, or as the basis for a tangible workplace advantage has always been unlawful under Title VII. The Ames case will not change that regardless of its outcome. Even after sustained attacks on corporate DEI, employers invested more in diversity programs in 2024 than in 2023 , according to Paradigm data from its platform users. Overall, 73% of companies surveyed had incorporated a DEI commitment into their company values. In 2024, 66% of the companies had a DEI budget\u2014up 12 percentage points from 2023. And in 2024, 60% of the companies had an explicit DEI strategy\u2014up 9 percentage points from 2024. Companies should continue to audit the design of their DEI programs as they enter 2025. Regardless of how the Supreme Court decides the Ames case, corporate leaders should expect increased scrutiny on DEI (https://hbr.org/2024/11/what-trumps-second-term-could-mean-for-dei) under Trump\u2019s second administration. https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelletravis/2024/12/22/the-supreme-court-case-that-will-fuel-the-corporate-dei-debate-in-2025/ (https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelletravis/2024/12/22/the-supreme-court-case-that-will-fuel-the-corporate-dei-debate-in-2025/)",

Transgender Activists Question the Movement\u2019s Confrontational Approach (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/us/politics/transgender-activists-rights.html) Facing diminishing public support, some activists say all-or-nothing tactics are not working. \u201cWe have to make it OK for someone to change their minds.\u201d Nov. 26, 2024 By Jeremy W. Peters (https://www.nytimes.com/by/jeremy-w-peters) ; Jeremy Peters has written about the evolution of the L.G.B.T.Q. movement for more than a decade. To get on the wrong side of transgender activists is often to endure their unsparing criticism. After a Democratic congressman defended parents who expressed concern about transgender athletes competing against their young daughters, a local party official and ally compared (https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/13/metro/seth-moulton-democrats-transgender-backlash-election-challenge-massachusetts/?event=event12) him to a Nazi \u201ccooperator\u201d and a group called \u201cNeighbors Against Hate\u201d organized (https://abc3340.com/news/nation-world/protesters-descend-on-democratic-congressmans-office-over-transgender-comments-seth-moulton-salem-massachusetts-lgbt-rights-salem-city-councilor-elect-kyle-davis) a protest outside his office. When J.K. Rowling said (https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/) that denying any relationship between sex and biology was \u201cdeeply misogynistic and regressive,\u201d a prominent L.G.B.T.Q. group accused (https://www.hrc.org/news/hrc-president-alphonso-david-responds-to-j-k-rowlings-latest-transphobic-b) her of betraying \u201creal feminism.\u201d A few angry critics posted videos of themselves burning her books. When the Biden administration convened a call with L.G.B.T.Q. allies last year to discuss new limits (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/us/transgender-athletes-title-ix-biden-adminstration.html) on the participation of transgender student athletes, one activist fumed on the call that the administration would be complicit in \u201cgenocide\u201d of transgender youth, according to two people with knowledge of the incident. Now, some activists say it is time to rethink and recalibrate their confrontational ways, and are pushing back against the more all-or-nothing voices in their coalition. \u201cWe have to make it OK for someone to change their minds,\u201d said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, executive director of Advocates for Transgender Equality. \u201cWe cannot vilify them for not being on our side. No one wants to join that team.\u201d They cite tactics, especially on social media, that became routine for devoted backers of the movement: Attempts to police language, such as excising the words \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d from discussions of pregnancy and abortion; decrying the misidentification of a transgender person as violence; insisting that everyone declare whether they prefer to be referred to as he, she or other pronouns. Some L.G.B.T.Q. activists have put pressure on liberal candidates for office to take positions that align with theirs \u2014 which can backfire. Republicans pummeled Vice President Kamala Harris in ads this year over the answers she gave on a 2019 questionnaire (https://www.aclu.org/documents/aclu-rights-for-all-candidate-questionnaire-2019) from the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that has been active in the transgender cause. The questionnaire asked Ms. Harris to commit to ensuring that transgender people in federal custody, \u201cincluding those in prison and immigration detention,\u201d could receive gender-transition surgery. Mr. Heng-Lehtinen, 38, who grew up in a prominent Republican family in Florida and came out to them as transgender after college, said that as painful as Mr. Trump\u2019s election may be for transgender people, their movement should see the benefit in treating skeptics less like enemies and more like future allies. \u201cNo one wants to feel stupid or condescended to,\u201d Mr. Heng-Lehtinen said. This soul-searching comes at a time when Democrats are engaging (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/newsom-california-counties-trump.html) in a broader discussion (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/politics/harris-trump-democrats-election.html) of how their efforts to advance social and racial justice in recent years may have appeared to be too judgmental and helped contribute to the perception that their party had lost its understanding of the problems Americans want politicians to prioritize. Republicans spent tens of millions of dollars on ads that accused Democrats of \u201cwokeness\u201d and capitalized on the unfamiliarity most Americans have with transgender people\u2019s lives, using hyperbole and distortions that often created false impressions of schoolhouse indoctrination and locker rooms full of predators. L.G.B.T.Q. activists are confronting a political landscape that has grown more hostile. More than two dozen states now limit access to transition medical treatment. Last week, House Republicans vowed (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/mike-johnson-transgender-women-ban-capitol-bathrooms.html) to bar transgender women from using women\u2019s restrooms in the Capitol, a not-so-subtle affront to Sarah McBride of Delaware, who this month became the first transgender person elected to Congress. Ms. McBride \u2014 who has insisted (https://x.com/SarahEMcBride/status/1858299359349076024) that she is a voice for all her constituents, and \u201cnot a spokesperson for a movement\u201d \u2014 said that she would follow House rules even if she disagreed with them. It is that kind of targeting from conservatives \u2014 which transgender people say is deeply personal and far too common \u2014 that makes many activists wary of relying on a gentler, more traditional political approach. Some of them saw avoidance in Ms. McBride\u2019s matter-of-fact response, and accused her of capitulating to the right. If they seem impatient, activists say, it is because they are. \u201cWhat we\u2019re facing is fundamental unfairness \u2014 and that is not coming from people who are interested in compromise and open debate,\u201d said Gillian Branstetter, a communications strategist with the American Civil Liberties Union who works on transgender advocacy. \u201cThese are people who are threatened by trans people\u2019s very existence. And, more importantly, they\u2019re trying to scapegoat us.\u201d The A.C.L.U. noted in a statement, for instance, that its 2019 questionnaire asked 19 questions on a range of subjects because voters needed to be able to \u201cdraw meaningful policy distinctions among the crowded field.\u201d Democrats are experiencing their own disillusionment with the national conversation over transgender rights, a debate that they say can sound dogmatic and intolerant. \u201cHere we are calling Republicans weird, and we\u2019re the party that makes people put pronouns in their email signature,\u201d said Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Democrat who ignited fury (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/us/politics/democrats-transgender-rights-moulton.html) and protests at his office after he expressed concern that transgender athletes could have an unfair advantage or hurt other athletes. Even so, he added, Democrats \u2014 and most Americans, for that matter \u2014 still want to protect transgender people from discrimination. \u201cHaving reasonable restrictions for safety and competitive fairness in sports seems like, well, it\u2019s very empirically a majority opinion,\u201d Mr. Moulton said. \u201cBut should we take civil rights away from trans people, so they can just get fired for being who they are? No.\u201d Transgender rights were not top of mind for most voters on Election Day. According to Gallup (https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx) , voters who were asked how important each of 22 national issues were in their voting decisions ranked transgender rights lowest. The public does not appear to be growing more empathetic to the transgender cause. Fewer (https://www.prri.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PRRI-Oct-2024-AVS-Draft_B.pdf) Americans today than two years ago say they support some of the rights that L.G.B.T.Q. activists have pushed for, like allowing children to undergo gender transition treatment, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. And multiple (https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-transgender-rights-lgbtq-donald-trump-3bb3ace81ff32b6dec382b486ec6a772) recent polls (https://www.prri.org/research/threats-to-american-democracy-ahead-of-an-unprecedented-presidential-election/) have found that a considerable majority of Americans believe advocacy for transgender rights has gone \u201ctoo far.\u201d This trend pains many longtime L.G.B.T.Q. activists, many of whom worked on the decades-long campaign to win widespread acceptance for gay and lesbian people. In interviews, some activists stressed that it was important to see the big picture: The L.G.B.T.Q. movement is working through a difficult pivot, trying to apply lessons from the same-sex marriage campaign to the newer fight for transgender equality. Evan Wolfson, founder of the pro-same-sex marriage group Freedom to Marry, said he and other activists learned that a key to victory in the long term was accepting small, less rewarding gains at first, like civil unions. \u201cWe always said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to ask for civil unions. But we\u2019ll take it as a mechanism to move people along\u2019,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said. He received criticism from all sides, with some gay rights activists dismissing civil unions as empty half-measures and many Democrats blaming electoral losses on the perception that the party was pushing same-sex marriage on a reluctant country. Eventually, the debate over legalizing civil unions in the 1990s evolved into dialogue over full marriage rights by the 2000s, culminating in the next decade with the Supreme Court decision establishing (https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html) same-sex marriage as a constitutional right. The discussion about transgender rights is \u201cstill a relatively new one \u2014 and a growing one,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said. \u201cThat conversation takes time.\u201d Mara Keisling, an activist who founded the National Center for Transgender Equality in 2002, remembered an adage she used 20 years ago about legislative priorities: \u201cYou can\u2019t say \u2018Don\u2019t fire them\u2019 until you can say \u2018Don\u2019t kill them\u2019\u201d \u2014 meaning that advocates should focus first on measures that reinforced the fundamental humanity of transgender people, such as hate-crime protections. Then, she said, you can push more effectively for laws about discrimination. Ms. Keisling said too many activists today are distracted by counterproductive debates \u2014 boycotting Ms. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter series, for example, and insisting that there are no reasonable objections to allowing transgender women into high-level sports. Ms. Keisling noted that L.G.B.T.Q. activists lost credibility with many Americans once they started accusing people of bigotry over sports. \u201cWe looked unreasonable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be talking about the 7-year-old who just wants to play soccer with her friends.\u201d (Ms. Keisling insists she is hardly na\u00efve about the animosity from the right; it has been directed at her personally. Her image was used in one of the Trump campaign ads that attacked Democrats over transgender rights this year.) Mr. Heng-Lehtinen of Advocates for Transgender Equality said he agreed that the movement needed a more persuasive message on sports. School districts and athletics associations, he said, have long been dealing with the issue of transgender athletes. The matter should be left to them, and not to the whims of Republican legislators, he added. Image \u201cI don\u2019t think we are best served by imposing a one-size-fits-all solution,\u201d he said, adding that \u201csweeping and crude\u201d bans on transgender athletes are just that. Advocates said their research had found that the most effective messaging takes into account that most Americans do not know a lot about life as a transgender person, and reinforces the basic idea that transgender people want what everyone else wants: fairness, respect and love. \u201cIt is our job to break the misinformation down and to say compassionately, \u2018It\u2019s perfectly understandable that you have questions,\u2019\u201d Mr. Heng-Lehtinen said. Put more directly, he added, \u201cThat\u2019s not yelling at someone.\u201d",

But how is the generation viewed by hiring managers? A new survey from ResumeBuilder.com shows some hiring managers are avoiding them all together \u2014 even though demographic trends suggest that strategy is a substantial risk. In a survey of U.S. workers involved in hiring for entry-level positions, ResumeBuilder found 31% of hiring managers said they avoid hiring Gen Zers and would prefer to hire older workers. The top reasons include Gen Zers asking for too much money (42%); acting entitled (41%); lacking communication skills (39%); and not being prepared (36%). Of the 94% of hiring managers surveyed who said they have interviewed Gen Zers, many noted having experienced Gen Zers acting \u201cinappropriately.\u201d That could include not dressing appropriately (58%), struggling with eye contact (57%) or using inappropriate language (19%), among other reasons. With the baby boomers aging out of the workforce, experts have said it will be pivotal for employers to forge an authentic bond with Gen Z.

Making matters more complicated, Gen Z is a smaller generation and subsequent generations after them are smaller as well, making it paramount for organizations to connect with younger employees. \u201cRecognizing the unique challenges that Gen Zers face in assimilating into a company\u2019s culture is the initial step to effectively hiring this generation,\u201d Haller said. \u201cTo address this, many organizations are instituting mentoring programs specifically tailored for entry-level employees. Furthermore, there is a growing trend of implementing etiquette training across the board.\u201d More than half of hiring managers (54%) responded they have had to fire a Gen Zer. Of that group, 5% said they had to fire a Gen Zer within a day of them starting, 17% within a week, and 36% a month. Another element that may help Gen Z workers become further acclimated is office etiquette training and coaching around soft skills.

Executive presence (EP) is typically perceived as consisting of three elements in descending order of importance: gravitas, skillful communication, and the \u201cright\u201d appearance. The author\u2019s new research shows that while confidence and decisiveness are still paramount for gravitas, pedigree has become less central, and new weight is given to inclusiveness and respect for others. On the communication front, superior speaking skills and the ability to command a room still lead the list of desirable attributes, but comfort on Zoom, a \u201clisten to learn\u201d orientation, and authenticity are on the rise. Projecting authenticity is also key to the appearance component of EP; so are dressing for the \u201cnew normal,\u201d having an online image, and showing up in person. This article offers a playbook for developing six attributes that increasingly factor into executive presence, citing the examples of a dozen leaders who have cracked the code.",

In recent months, a flurry of litigation has aimed to translate the court\u2019s race-blind stance on education to corporate diversity and inclusion policies. Companies have long tried to eliminate inequality in their ranks, in part by encouraging the hiring and promotion of women and racial minorities. But recent lawsuits claim those efforts perpetuate discrimination on the basis of race and gender \u2014 the very injustice they claim to stamp out. Here\u2019s what you should know about the growing legal battle over corporate diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Does the Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action apply to companies? The short answer is that it doesn\u2019t \u2014 at least not directly. Unlike colleges and universities, private employers were already barred from making decisions based on race under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Companies cannot set aside a portion of jobs for minorities, or hire an applicant solely because of their race. Decades of legal precedent have allowed employers to take race into account, especially in the interest of countering historical inequities in their workforces, according to Stacy Hawkins, a law professor at Rutgers University and a former corporate employment lawyer who specializes in diversity. But there\u2019s growing pushback from litigants eager to see those practices curtailed as well. \u201cQuite frankly, the most risky thing an employer can do is make any employment decision explicitly on the basis of race,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cBut you can be committed to diversity in your workplace and take steps that are informed by that commitment.\u201d That might entail eliminating exclusionary parts of the hiring process or seeking alternative talent pools, Hawkins said. It could also mean providing employee resource groups, mentorship or other forms of support to members of underrepresented groups once they\u2019re on board. Wasn\u2019t DEI under fire before the court decision? Yes, and corporate commitments to these endeavors have been waning. In the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020, companies made $340 billion in commitments to improve racial equity in their ranks between May 2020 and October 2022, according to data from the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility. But in the past year, companies have been paring back DEI roles. Conservative politicians and advocacy groups also have been challenging DEI practices. For example, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has barred spending on DEI at public colleges and universities in his state, declaring \u201cFlorida is where \u2018woke\u2019 goes to die.\u201d In July, 13 Republican attorneys general sent a letter urging Microsoft and other Fortune 100 companies to reexamine their DEI policies in response to the Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action. The letter threatened \u201cserious legal consequences\u201d for companies that rely on race-based employment preferences, including \u201cexplicit racial quotas and preferences in hiring, recruiting, retention, promotion and advancement.\u201d Companies take an expansive range of approaches to enhancing diversity, from tailoring their recruiting to better reach underrepresented groups to helping minority employees feel supported in the workplace, according to Stephanie Creary, assistant professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. And ever since these efforts began, in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, they\u2019ve faced significant pushback. \u201cThe government does not tell people how to execute this,\u201d Creary said. Companies \u201chave to figure out for themselves what that means and what practices they have to put into place.\u201d Modern incarnations of DEI policies emerged from major racial discrimination lawsuits, Creary said, such as the 2000 case in which Coca-Cola agreed to a $192 million settlement \u2014 a record sum for a corporate racial discrimination case at that time. To settle claims that the company relegated Black employees to the bottom of its pay scale, Coca-Cola was required to change performance evaluations and its processes for staffing and promotion decisions. Now, corporate DEI practices are facing their own legal pushback. How is the legal fight playing out? In recent months, a steady trickle of lawsuits and decisions has challenged the legality of DEI policies and practices in the workplace. A few have been filed by the American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER), a group founded by conservative activist Edward Blum, who was behind the cases that culminated in the Supreme Court striking down affirmative action in college admissions. In early August, the group filed a lawsuit against Fearless Fund, an Atlanta-based venture capital firm run by two Black women, alleging that the fund is engaging in racial discrimination by running a grant program exclusively for early-stage companies owned by Black women. On Tuesday, the firm notched a big victory when a federal judge declined AAER\u2019s request for an injunction, which would have blocked the program. On Saturday, however, a panel of federal appellate judges temporarily blocked the fund from awarding grants, effectively reversing Tuesday\u2019s ruling. In September, AAER also sued two major corporate law firms, arguing that their fellowships aimed at bolstering diversity amount to racial discrimination because they exclude non-minorities. Shortly after the suits were filed, one of the firms, Morrison Foerster, removed all references to race from online descriptions of the fellowship, opening the program to students of all backgrounds. In September, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, one of the firms representing Fearless Fund, also changed the criteria for its diversity and inclusion scholarship. The award is now for students \u201cwho have demonstrated resilience and excellence on their path toward a career in law,\u201d according to reporting from Bloomberg Law, as opposed to previous language specifying it was for \u201cstudents who identify with an underrepresented group.\u201d America First Legal, the conservative nonprofit group backed by former Donald Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has filed complaints in recent months against Kellogg\u2019s, Nordstrom and Activision Blizzard, alleging that their diversity and inclusion policies constitute racial discrimination. In July, a federal judge in Tennessee thrust the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s 8(a) Business Development program into chaos after he struck down a provision that equated race with social disadvantage. For about 50 years, the program has opened a pipeline to billions in government contracting dollars for historically disadvantaged groups. Under the July ruling, a business owner\u2019s Black, Hispanic, Asian or Native American heritage no longer automatically qualifies as evidence of social disadvantage. Instead, in a mass email distributed by SBA officials on Aug. 22, business owners were instructed to submit an essay demonstrating that their race had somehow hindered their success. What DEI practices are most likely to face scrutiny? The purpose of DEI efforts is to \u201cmake workplaces that really work for everyone,\u201d according to Alexis Robertson, director of DEI at law firm Foley & Lardner. But there\u2019s a misconception, she said, that these policies unfairly give preference to some groups over others \u2014 a claim advanced in many ongoing lawsuits. People of color and women held less than 14 percent of C-suite roles across Fortune 500 and S&P 500 companies as of 2023, according to data from executive search firm Crist Kolder Associates. In the field of law, which has already faced suits over diversity fellowships, less than 5 percent of practicing attorneys are Black, even though Black people make up roughly 15 percent of the U.S. population, according to the American Bar Association. About 10 percent of practicing attorneys fall into other minority groups. Robertson said she is optimistic the tension around DEI will encourage companies to thoroughly examine their practices and develop more sophisticated solutions . If your organization\u2019s DEI efforts amount to: \u201c\u2018We\u2019re giving some impermissible preference in hiring or promotion,\u2019\u201d Robertson said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to get sued.\u201d Fearing legal challenge, organizations are likely to move away from DEI programs that exclusively target certain populations, such as minorities , Robertson said, because \u201cthese efforts invite scrutiny.\u201d While some demographic-specific efforts will probably remain, overall, corporate DEI is likely to s hift and focus more on \u201cuniversal\u201d efforts to make recruiting, hiring and retention more successful for everyone. A sticking point is likely to be how the courts draw the line between diversity goals and quotas. The use of racial quotas has been illegal for decades under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but companies have long been permitted to enact targeted, temporary measures to improve diversity in their workforces , according to Sheila Willis, co-chair of the affirmative action and federal contract compliance practice group at law firm Fisher Phillips. \u201cWhen I hear \u2018quota,\u2019 I hear a requirement,\u201d Willis said. \u201cA \u2018goal\u2019 is something that\u2019s more aspirational.\u201d This issue is being interrogated in a proposed class-action lawsuit from former employers of newspaper publisher Gannett, which accused the company of racial discrimination. The suit claims White workers were unfairly terminated or passed over for opportunities and replaced with less-qualified minority candidates (RP note: hahahahaha!!!) amid Gannett\u2019s efforts to increase the number of people of color in leadership roles by 30 percent by 2025. In a statement, Gannett declined to discuss the lawsuit but said it \u201calways seeks to recruit and retain the most qualified individuals for all roles within the company.\u201d \u201cWe will vigorously defend our practice of ensuring equal opportunities for all our valued employees against this meritless lawsuit,\u201d Polly Grunfeld Sack, Gannett\u2019s chief legal counsel, told The Washington Post in an email. What should employers do about all this? Experts on all sides of this issue are clear: Now is the time for employers to closely examine their DEI efforts and ensure they\u2019re complying with the law. Employers should be \u201cvigilant and thoughtful\u201d about the language used not only in their explicit DEI policies and practices, but also in their formal and informal communication about them , Willis said. She recommended that companies involve internal or external legal counsel in their evaluations. \u201cRegardless of how noble corporations may be with their DEI goals, the legality of this is now under the microscope,\u201d said Leon Prieto, professor of management at Clayton State University. \u201cBecause of the fear of litigation, they have no choice but to adapt.\u201d Despite the scrutiny, Prieto cautioned companies against backing away from DEI efforts. But in demonstrating their commitment, companies must \u201cdo a more robust job of communicating their goals and their vision,\u201d Prieto added. \u201cThey need to let people know that DEI is not about just hiring ethnic minorities for the sake of hiring ethnic minorities.\u201d",

    "message": "Workers are waking up to emails and team-meeting requests with a jarring message: They aren\u2019t fired, but their jobs are gone. People on the receiving end of these memos describe running through a range of emotions, from relief that they\u2019re still employed to a sense of dread that their bosses secretly want them to leave. They are also facing a labor market that isn\u2019t as robust as a year ago, leaving many to believe that the best option is to stay put and hunt internally for a better fit. Adidas, Adobe, IBM and Salesforce, among others, have reassigned employees as part of corporate restructurings. Mentions of reassignment, or similar terms, during company earnings calls more than tripled between last August and this month, according to data from AlphaSense, a financial-research platform. \u201cReassigning is definitely a huge part of the dynamic right now,\u201d said Andy Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm. For companies that spent several years\u2014and significant money\u2014to hire top talent, reassigning workers to new roles can be a way to fill jobs vital to future plans while trimming costs associated with old strategies, say human-resources executives. It can also be a waiting game. Employees to whom it would be costly to pay severance or months of unemployment benefits might decide to leave on their own if they feel stuck in a job they don\u2019t want, executive coaches say. U.S.-based companies announced 42% fewer job cuts in July than they did in June, Challenger said. July job cuts were also 8% lower than the prior-year period, marking the first time this year that monthly job cuts were lower than in 2022 . In interviews and online forums, many workers said they worried whether their reassignment meant they would eventually be pushed out the door. They also wondered how to work their way out of job purgatory and back into a position they actually want. \u201cI got the sense that it was like: \u2018We appreciate everything you did so we didn\u2019t lay you off, so you can either make the best of this or go find another job somewhere else,\u2019 \u201d said Matt Conrad, a 34-year-old senior sales-enablement specialist at IBM who went through two reassignments in two years before landing his current role last fall. In Conrad\u2019s first reassignment in 2021, a manager scheduled a call to notify him that his manager role was eliminated. He was given a new job selling software he had no experience with, a move he said took a toll on his mental health. Later that year, Conrad found a new job at IBM through a former manager that was better suited to his skill set. Then, in January 2022, that team was eliminated and he was reassigned again. Conrad asked the HR department to help him to find his remote, senior sales-coach role, a process that took six months. Not quitting when he was reassigned was a matter of principle, he said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give in because I was a top performer and it just wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d IBM didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Getting caught up in a reorganization can create anxiety for workers, but it\u2019s sometimes a genuine move on the company\u2019s part to avoid letting people go, said Roberta Matuson, an executive coach and adviser to businesses including General Motors and Microsoft on human-resources issues. \u201cThey\u2019re basically signaling to you: \u2018Look, this is the only way for me to have a job here for you, I need to reassign you, so wink, wink, if I were you, I would take the assignment,\u2019 \u201d she said. Other times, workers are purposefully pushed into jobs management knows they will be miserable in, prompting them to quit. \u201cThey could be putting you out to pasture,\u201d Matuson said. Signals to look for include reassignment to a job that is far below the pay or skill level you currently have, Matuson said. Other warning signs: Being offered a role that requires relocating when your boss knows moving isn\u2019t a viable option for you, or being reassigned to a division that\u2019s rumored to be on the chopping block. Employees suspicious or nervous about a reassignment should ask their managers why, specifically, it\u2019s happening and what the reassignment means for their career path, said Naomi Sutherland, a global lead of talent development with Korn Ferry, a consulting firm. The answers could reveal whether a job transfer is personal. Without good information, \u201cpeople are going to fill a void of information with whatever story they\u2019re going to tell themselves,\u201d she said. Most of the time, there is little legal recourse for workers if their company reassigns them, employment lawyers say. One exception is when a worker can demonstrate the reassignment was retaliatory, said Angela L. Walker, an employment attorney with Blanchard & Walker in Ann Arbor, Mich. The bar is high, she added. The employee would have to show prior evidence of discriminatory treatment or that they were unfairly singled out. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots of examples in my practice where employees are told they\u2019re being let go in a \u2018restructuring\u2019 and it turns out that they\u2019re the only one affected, or they\u2019re the only one affected in their group,\u201d Walker said. Grant Gurewitz, 32, said it took time to adjust to a new role in Seattle earlier this year when his software company eliminated his position as head of growth marketing for employee experience in North America. He was given 24 hours to make a choice between two other jobs, or leave. He picked a global head of growth marketing role that came with more responsibilities but without a pay increase. He chose to look on the bright side, because a global role probably would\u2019ve been the next position he wanted and it builds on his existing skill set. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of runway for me to learn and grow and develop in this role, which is the glass-half-full approach to all of this that\u2019s happened,\u201d he said.",

    "message": "Conservative groups are challenging Amazon, Comcast and others using many of the same arguments that boosted minority representation in the workforce. By Theo Francis (https://www.wsj.com/news/author/theo-francis) Aug. 8, 2023 5:30 am ET Conservative legal activists successfully challenged (https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-against-affirmative-action-c94b5a9c?mod=article_inline) the use of affirmative action by universities. Now they are going after diversity initiatives widely deployed across American corporations. Some companies are already reconsidering their efforts. In lawsuits, shareholder letters and petitions to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, activists are using some of the same tactics that progressive groups have used to advance diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs. They are arguing that companies are violating rules against race- and sex-discrimination, including those drawn from legislation designed to secure the rights of Black Americans. Comcast (https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CMCSA) settled a case accusing it of illegally favoring minority-owned small-business customers with grants and marketing advice. Amazon (https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN) has been sued in Texas over a program offering an extra $10,000 to Black- or Latino-owned delivery-service contractors. Starbucks (https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SBUX) directors and executives are being sued by a shareholder arguing they violated their duty to investors by supporting diversity policies. A federal lawsuit against Amazon.com targets a program awarding an additional $10,000 to Black, Latino and Native American delivery-service contractors to defray startup costs. PHOTO: KATHY TRAN/BLOOMBERG NEWS Dozens of corporate law firms and major employers have received letters from Republican officials (https://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-attorneys-general-warn-top-u-s-businesses-over-discrimination-1eb78d29?mod=article_inline) warning them to adhere to laws prohibiting racial quotas and preferences in employment and contracting decisions. Edward Blum, who also organized the challenge (https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-supreme-court-ed-blum-100b36c3?mod=article_inline) that culminated in the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn affirmative action (https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-against-affirmative-action-c94b5a9c?mod=article_inline) , used a recently formed nonprofit group to sue Georgia investment manager Fearless Fund, charging that a grant program for startups is discriminatory. Fearless makes early-stage investments in businesses run by women of color. Companies say their initiatives fall within the law. Many say they remain committed to increasing the demographic diversity of their workforces and suppliers, citing business benefits (https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-business-case-for-more-diversity-11572091200?mod=article_inline) and the hurdles some groups continue to face in American corporations. Privately, many are asking their lawyers (https://www.wsj.com/articles/companiesexpectnew-challenges-todiversitypolicies-after-court-ruling-4bf48c1d?mod=article_inline) if and how much they should modify their methods in light of the affirmative-action decision. Many of the legal efforts against corporate diversity programs predate the high court\u2019s June 29 decision. That ruling, centered squarely on higher-education admissions, didn\u2019t address employment or business practices. But it added momentum to an effort by conservative activists and public officials to challenge corporate diversity programs. Companies have long relied on rationales similar to those buttressing affirmative action at universities\u2014that there are benefits to diversity. By dismissing that rationale, the high court weakened the justification for other programs that promote it. \u201cAnything a company\u2019s doing that is treating someone differently because of their race, even if it\u2019s a small part of the decision-making process, is going to be scrutinized,\u201d said Dan Lennington, a former Wisconsin deputy solicitor general and deputy counsel for Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, the legal group behind the Comcast lawsuit. Employment lawyers say it is likely a matter of time before one of these cases reaches the Supreme Court. Some companies have decided they aren\u2019t going to wait for the court to weigh in. That is especially true for programs that were quickly adopted after the May 2020 killing of George Floyd in police custody, said Angela Berg, who led the global DEI practice at HR consulting firm Mercer and now consults independently. Some executives \u201cwere uncomfortable with equity programs from the get-go,\u201d said Berg, referring to initiatives such as mentorship or training programs. The Supreme Court has changed the risk calculation, she said. Companies are evaluating diversity programs in light of litigation threats that often seem designed to stoke public fear, said Fordham University law professor Atinuke Adediran. She has received inquiries on the subject from an association of human-resources officers at large companies. \u201cMost of what the firms are doing for diversity is legal,\u201d she said. \u201cCompanies may need to be ready to defend themselves.\u201d A Civil War weapon Cable giant Comcast limited a small-business grant program to companies at least 51% owned and operated by someone identifying as Black, indigenous, a person of color, or female\u2014people the company said had been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, in suing Comcast in April 2022, cited the 1866 Civil Rights Act. One provision often referred to as Section 1981 says all Americans should have the same rights to sue and enforce contracts \u201cas is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d The Wisconsin Institute, which says it supports litigation promoting \u201cindividual initiative and ordered liberty that leads to prosperity,\u201d essentially turned that section on its head by gathering several white, male business owners as plaintiffs. In mid-September, when Comcast announced the next round of grants, it opened the program (https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-rise-investment-fund-grants-small-businesses-covid-19-pandemic)) to all small businesses. Two months later, Comcast settled the litigation. A Comcast spokesman declined to comment. In a news release about the program in May, Comcast described the program as evolving \u201cfrom helping businesses survive the pandemic, to helping businesses and their communities thrive with a focus on economic growth.\u201d A federal lawsuit against Amazon.com filed outside Dallas in July 2022 also invokes the 1866 law. It targets a program awarding an additional $10,000 to Black, Latino and Native American delivery-service contractors to defray startup costs. The lawsuit also criticizes an Amazon program aimed at helping Black-owned businesses sell products on Amazon\u2019s website. The plaintiff, a Denton County, Texas, resident, wants to apply to start an Amazon delivery-service contractor, but says she won\u2019t until the company eliminates the assistance for minority contractors or offers whites and Asians the same benefit, the complaint says. The plaintiff can\u2019t apply to become an Amazon delivery service partner \u201cwithout subjecting herself to racial discrimination,\u201d the lawsuit says. The case seeks class-action status. It was filed by attorneys including the general counsel of America First Legal, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit headed by former Trump administration adviser Stephen Miller. America First Legal describes itself as combating \u201can unholy alliance of corrupt special interests, big tech titans, the fake news media, and liberal Washington politicians.\u201d Amazon has moved to dismiss the lawsuit, saying its selection process for delivery contractors is race-neutral and that the plaintiff doesn\u2019t have standing to sue because she hasn\u2019t applied to be an Amazon contractor. In court filings, the company calls her complaint \u201cthe epitome of an abstract and generalized grievance by a member of the general population about an internal corporate program that has no actual effect on her.\u201d Amazon declined to comment on the lawsuit. \u201cWe believe in the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion,\u201d a spokesman said in a written statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll investigate the potential impact of any legal decisions on our programs and adjust as necessary to comply with the law.\u201d The workplace discrimination argument Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bans workplace discrimination. The recent affirmative-action decision didn\u2019t address employment practices directly. But Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch in a concurring opinion noted \u201cmaterially identical language\u201d on discrimination in the laws governing higher education and employment. Starbucks officers and directors were sued in August 2022 by National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank that owns 56 shares in the coffee chain. It accuses Starbucks of violating Title VII and Section 1981, and the officials of breaching their fiduciary duty to shareholders by embracing policies it says violate antidiscrimination law in areas including employment, supplier contracts and executive compensation. Under the policies, Starbucks says it wants at least 30% of its U.S. workforce at all levels to be Black, indigenous or people of color by 2025. It plans to implement an analytics tool that lets managers see their progress and uses workforce diversity measures to help set executive pay. Starbucks and company officials are seeking to dismiss the case, with a hearing scheduled for Friday. They say NCPPR hasn\u2019t shown any real harm from the policies, which are covered by a legal principle that gives company officials broad discretion in running their business, and that courts have upheld diversity policies as permissible. Acceding to the lawsuit\u2019s demands would leave Starbucks vulnerable to other litigation, they say. \u201cWe remain committed to creating a culture of warmth and belonging, where everyone is welcome,\u201d a company spokeswoman said. In court, Starbucks and its officials also argue NCPPR doesn\u2019t represent shareholders, who have rejected previous proxy proposals from the group suggesting Starbucks favors liberal or \u201cwoke\u201d perspectives. Coca-Cola (https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KO) is among the companies that has already backtracked. In early 2021, then-General Counsel Bradley Gayton addressed a letter to outside law firms saying that 30% of new legal work for the soda giant should be performed by lawyers who are women, LGBTQ+, disabled or members of racial and ethnic minority groups. Law firms had to report demographic data to Coke, which could cut their fees if the guidelines weren\u2019t met, the letter said. Gayton stepped down from the role three months later. American Civil Rights Project, a nonprofit law firm that also represents NCPPR in its Starbucks lawsuit, threatened to sue Coke officials on behalf of shareholders. In a letter to the company that June, the group called the policies \u201ctextbook violations\u201d of Section 1981. In early 2022 Gayton\u2019s successor, Monica Howard Douglas, wrote to the American Civil Rights Project that while the company remained fully committed to advancing DEI in the legal profession, she had contacted law firms to tell them the guidelines were never company policy. A chilling effect America First Legal Foundation, the group backing the Texas lawsuit against Amazon, has written to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, urging the four current commissioners to bypass the usual complaint process and open investigations into diversity practices at a range of brand-name companies. Andrea Lucas, who was nominated to the commission by President Trump, declined to comment on the likelihood that she or other commissioners would open investigations. She said she sees \u201csignificant legal and practical risk\u201d in many corporate diversity programs. \u201cEqual opportunity is our charge,\u201d she said of the agency\u2019s mission, \u201cbut the law does not demand equal outcomes.\u201d Civil-rights lawyers say conservative activists\u2019 arguments distort the original purpose of laws designed to protect groups that, historically, have had fewer labor-market opportunities or difficulty cracking corporate ceilings. \u201cThe intent here is more political gain and a chilling effect\u2014unfortunately it\u2019s effective,\u201d said Katy Youker, an attorney with the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which has been tracking challenges to corporate programs. In Florida, a federal judge last year halted enforcement of provisions in HB 7, better known as the Stop Woke Act, which would have restricted private employers from conducting some diversity-related training. The judge said the measures violated companies\u2019 free speech rights. Gov. Ron DeSantis (https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/ron-desantis) \u2019s administration has appealed the decision. The pressure leaves employers vulnerable to litigation for either going too far or not far enough in addressing barriers to equity and inclusion, lawyers say. \u201cEmployers still have obligations to comply with civil rights statutes,\u201d said Charles McLaurin, senior counsel with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Rolling back DEI programs designed to expand workplace opportunities, he added, \u201chas the potential of creating a hostile environment for certain marginalized groups. Companies would still face exposure.\u201d Write to Theo Francis at theo.francis@wsj.com (mailto:theo.francis@wsj.com) and Lauren Weber at Lauren.Weber@wsj.com (mailto:Lauren.Weber@wsj.com)",

The reason? Few clients are willing to build the infrastructure they need to actually succeed. Stop me if you've heard this before. Your leader is \"thrilled\" about DEI training. They saw a speaker or facilitator at a conference and excitedly reached out to see if they could bring the same energy to their organization. Before you know it, the speaker is delivering their training to a partially-engaged audience at an event with middling attendance, and before you know it, the event is over. Things go back to normal. Nothing's changed. This is an all-too-common outcome for many organizations and leaders with good intentions, but without DEI experience or discipline. They make the following red flag errors: \u26a0\ufe0f They don't know the problems they need to solve with DEI interventions, trainings or otherwise. \u26a0\ufe0f They don't know what behaviors or outcomes are tied to those problems, or how to measure them. \u26a0\ufe0f They don't pick a training that corresponds with the problem they need to fix or the solution they aim to create. \u26a0\ufe0f They either have no intention for the training to be effective or instead expect that the training will singlehandedly solve all DEI issues. \u26a0\ufe0f They have no follow-up plan for reinforcing the skills, practices, or knowledge the training imparted. \u26a0\ufe0f They don't engage key leaders in the organization to act on, let alone scale, the impact from the training. \u26a0\ufe0f They don't measure success or long-term impact, and thus can't gauge the impact of the training. But here's the thing: each one of these mistakes can be fixed. And if your organization is able to do so, DEI training can go from being a useless money sink to a powerful tool in your overall DEI #strategy (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=strategy&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7094714318922919936) . The steps are simple. \u2714\ufe0f Identify the problem you're hoping to solve with training, using focus groups, employee surveys, and people analytics data. \u2714\ufe0f Select measurable behaviors or outcomes related to the problem that you can assess, and use them to operationalize your starting point. \u2714\ufe0f Pick a training that directly corresponds with the problems you want to fix and the outcomes you want to create. Be rigorous with your selection of training vendor. \u2714\ufe0f Set realistic expectations for the impact of this training, and situate it among other existing or potential DEI interventions. \u2714\ufe0f Make a follow-up plan for reinforcing the skills, practices, or knowledge the training imparted that engage and involve key leaders. \u2714\ufe0f Re-measure the behaviors or outcomes you measured at the onset for a followup analysis, gauge the success (or not) of the initiative, and refine your future efforts using that knowledge. \u2714\ufe0f Repeat. DEI training CAN work, but this\u2014an accountability framework and DEI infrastructure\u2014is a hard requirement.

And it\u2019s likely not for the reasons they think. - Diversity Delivers at the Bottom Line: Some companies may be quietly shifting their attention away from DEI as other business challenges arise. However, companies that focus on succeeding in DEI are also more likely to see better business results. - Companies Fail to Deliver on DEI Promises: In the wake of a flurry of company commitments to DEI over the past few years, many companies haven\u2019t done enough to follow through in their practices. And leaders\u2014especially experienced ones\u2014are becoming more skeptical. - Inclusion Drives Bench Strength: Amid CEOs\u2019 increasing concern about the state of their empty leadership benches, companies need to expand their definitions of leadership potential. Those that are embracing more inclusive practices are seeing more strength in their bench. - The Burnout Generation: Preparing next-generation leaders for higher-level roles is a top concern for most organizations. Unfortunately, younger generations are reporting more burnout, which should cause organizations to rethink the leadership culture they are creating. - Quality DEI Programs Deliver Results: Top company executives have often wondered whether the investment in DEI programs really pays off. The data show that these programs do deliver better business results, but only if the programs are top quality. - Inclusion Doesn\u2019t Require an Office: As many companies question the value of returning workers to the office, a key question centers on whether a remote work culture can be inclusive. The answer is a strong yes, but it depends on managers\u2019 behavior.",

It's a great, short read that defines oppression (immobilization and reduction of a group or category of people) and distinguishes it from suffering or pain related to occasional and/or accidental specific events that occur in life and have nothing to do with one's identity. It talks about the double bind that many oppressed people must navigate, and how oppression is invisible when seen from a microscopic (individual, one-off behaviors or events) instead of macroscopic (systemic) perspective. It walks us through a very effective metaphor of oppression being like a bird in a cage, and unpacks oppression from the seemingly simple and innocent act of a man opening a door for a woman. Hope you have a little time to take it in. RP",

    "message": "Hi, team. Our client asked Andrea and I yesterday for sources to back up that POC tend to be perceived as underperforming or judged more rigorously than their white peers . We put this list together, and am passing it along to you in case your client asks you a similar question in the future. We Just Can\u2019t Handle Diversity (https://hbr.org/2016/07/we-just-cant-handle-diversity) and her book Pedigree: How Elite Students Get Elite Jobs (https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691155623/pedigree) (2015, Princeton University Press) - A Northwestern Kellogg Prof. Lauren A. Rivera study found that Black (as well as Hispanic) men were often seen as lacking \u201cpolish\u201d and moved to the reject pile, even when they were strong in other areas, whereas white men who lacked \u201cpolish\u201d were deemed coachable and kept in the running.\u201d In that same study\u2026. FOR THOSE WHO HAD MATH ERRORS\u2026 Black candidates were \u201crejected for not having the right skills, and men were given a pass\u2014interviewers assumed they were having an \u2018off\u2019 day.\u201d Achieving Meritocracy in the Workplace (https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/achieving-meritocracy-in-the-workplace/) - MIT Sloan School of Mgmt Prof. Emilio J. Castilla (a professor at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management) looked at almost 9,000 employees in a large service-sector company. The company was committed to diversity and had implemented a merit-driven system intended to reward high performance equitably. Turned out women, ethnic minorities, and non-U.S.-born employees received a smaller increase in compensation compared with white men, despite holding the same jobs , working in the same units , having the same supervisors , and receiving the same performance score . Even if we\u2019re personally committed to being unbiased and impartial, and even if our organization is committed to diversity and inclusion as it is, we need to always continue to engage in proactive strategies that are designed to neutralize unconscious biases in our people decisions. Black Workers Really Do Need to Be Twice as Good (https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/why-black-workers-really-do-need-to-be-twice-as-good/409276/) - African American employees tend to receive more scrutiny from their bosses than their white colleagues, meaning that small mistakes are more likely to be caught, which over time leads to worse performance reviews and lower wages. A new paper (http://www.nber.org/papers/w21612) from the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that when it comes to getting and keeping jobs, the notion of having to be \u2018twice as good\u2019 might be more than just a platitude. When Whites Get a Free Pass (https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/opinion/research-shows-white-privilege-is-real.html?referrer&_r=0) - Redzo Mujcic and Paul Frijters, economists at the University of Queensland, trained and assigned 29 young adult testers (from both genders and different ethnic groups) to board public buses in Brisbane and insert an empty fare card into the bus scanner. After the scanner made a loud sound informing the driver that the card did not have enough value, the testers said, \u201cI do not have any money, but I need to get to\u201d a station about 1.2 miles away. With more than 1,500 observations, the study uncovered substantial, statistically significant race discrimination. Bus drivers were twice as willing to let white testers ride free as black testers (72 % versus 36 % of the time). Bus drivers showed some relative favoritism toward testers who shared their own race, but even black drivers still favored white testers over black testers (allowing free rides 83 % versus 68 % of the time). The study also found that racial disparities persisted when the testers wore business attire or dressed in army uniforms. For example, testers wearing army uniforms were allowed to ride free 97 % of the time if they were white, but only 77 % of the time if they were black. Black And Latinx Employees Face Bias In Job Performance Feedback, Study Finds (https://peopleofcolorintech.com/front/black-and-latinx-employees-face-bias-in-job-performance-feedback-study-finds/?utm_source=POCIT+Newsletter&utm_campaign=adc411a020-Newsletter+291_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_5e3350f142-adc411a020-332407902) - Textio surveyed over 25,000 business employees and also analyzed actual performance feedback documents, and noted consistent patterns of inequity by gender, race, and age. Asian people get more feedback than people of any other race\u201425% more than white people\u2014and Black men get the least feedback of all. Black and Latinx people receive 2.4 times more feedback that is not actionable compared to their white and Asian colleagues. Black and Latinx people are more likely to receive feedback that concerns their personality, rather than the quality of their work. Black and Latinx people are over twice as likely to report being described as passionate, which is often a euphemism for having a strong personality and being unable to get along with others. ack women receive nearly 9 times as much feedback that\u2019s not actionable compared to white men under 40. White men under 40 get the word \u201cbrilliant\u201d in performance feedback 8.7 times more than women over 40.",

Some highlights: - For every 100 men promoted from entry level to manager, 87 women are promoted (82 women of color are promoted). - For every woman at the director level who gets promoted, two women directors are choosing to leave their company (Women leaders are about 1.5X as likely as men leaders to have switched jobs because their workload was unmanageable ) - Among employees who switched jobs in the past two years, 48% of women leaders say they did so because they wanted more opportunity to advance - Women leaders are 2X as likely as men leaders to spend substantial time on DEI work , and 40% of women leaders say their DEI work isn\u2019t acknowledged at all in performance reviews . - More than two-thirds of women under 30 say they care more than they did two years ago about flexibility and company commitment to well-being . - Latinas and Black women are significantly less likely than women of other races and ethnicities to report their manager regularly shows interest in their career development . - Asian women and Black women are less likely than women of other races and ethnicities to say that someone in a more senior role has publicly praised their accomplishments or advocated for a compensation increase for them. - 78% of companies say managers have been expected to do more over the last two years to support employee well-being , and 80% say managers have been expected to do more to promote inclusion on their teams. - Less than half of companies provide training for managers on how to minimize employee burnout and make sure promotions are equitable.

    "message": "Great podcast episode: Nikole Hannah-Jones and the Country We Have ( Throughline) Is history always political? Who gets to decide? What happens when you challenge common narratives? In this episode, Throughline's Rund Abdelfatah and Ramtin Arablouei explore these questions with Nikole Hannah-Jones, an investigative journalist at the New York Times and the creator of the 1619 Project, which is set to be released as a book later this year. The U.S. is steeped in wars over history. Historical narratives fuel public policy and discourse. Today, the most dramatic battleground is the 1619 Project. It has pushed people on both sides of the political spectrum to ask how our framing of the past affects the present, to interrogate what we remember and don't remember as a society \u2014 and whether we need a shared historical narrative to move forward.

    "message": "Hi, all \u2013 As we settle into an immediate future of providing virtual facilitation for our clients, I thought I would share some tips that I have recently compiled after reading and viewing guidance by professional presenters who have been doing recorded presentations for years. Lighting For best results, you should always face the strongest source of light. Be very careful of backlighting (strong lighting or windows directly behind you). Strong backlighting will wash away the details of your features and make your expressions harder for participants to see. Natural light is the best but artificial light can be arranged in front of you during your presentations. Be thoughtful about the positioning of light. If it is too high or too low it will cast shadows on your face. Experiment with the lighting for the look most comfortable for you. Positioning You should be positioned in the center of the screen and with your head well into the top third of the screen (see image). Your webcam should be at eye level. Looking down creates shadows on the neck and face that can be unflattering to some. Too much space between your head and the top of the screen feels odd and distracting to people used to the positioning of subjects from watching movies and television. Move close to the camera so that you are the object of attention. Place any notes you are using as close to your camera as you can. Not using notes and looking directly into the camera is best. It will feel odd at first but with practice it creates a more natural connection between participants. Sound Headsets tend to reduce the ambient sounds around you and isolate your voice better than internal PC microphones. If you are using a headset be aware of where the mic falls on your face. You don't want it directly below your nose or over your mouth. Many mics will pick up the sound of your breathing. You can usually place it along your jawline and be heard well. If you are using the internal PC mic alone be sure that you are in an isolated location that provides you with the silence needed during your session. Posture Sit up straight. Remember that because of perspective things closest the camera look the largest. If you are leaning back in your chair and your waist/midsection are closer to the camera than your head, your midsection will look larger. Some people suggest that if you sit on the front edge of your chair you will naturally sit straighter. Think about your posture. Sit up straight. Aesthetics Personal style is personal. I won't deign to provide guidance on your style other than to say from a camera standpoint, solids broadcast better than patterns. We also want to look professional during faciltation and to that end, collared shirts look better than t-shirts. Use your judgement but we always want to impress with our presentations -- both of the content and of ourselves. Ensuring we are neat, clean and well-groomed conveys an attention to detail that our clients expect.",

Check out the resources slide at the end for a great reading list - I'll send her further resources on when they are emailed to us.

As we try to decrease the number of people in public to reduce the spread of COVID-19, the Pikup app connects people at the store with neighbors nearby that need something. Originally developed by two U of M students to help make their classmates' lives easier, the focus quickly shifted to neighborhood connections, specifically helping those who are unable to leave their homes. Chosen for the Target + Techstars Accelerator Program in 2018 (https://t.e2ma.net/click/l360gc/5yojesb/hsjkqq) , the Pikup app allows users to share when they are running errands to local stores and take requests from neighbors who may need items. In just under a month, the app already has more than 100+ neighborhoods engaged and helping one another.

    "message": "Sharing from Facebook - rom a psychologist: After having thirty-one sessions this week with patients where the singular focus was COVID-19 and how to cope, I decided to consolidate my advice and make a list that I hope is helpful to all. I can't control a lot of what is going on right now, but I can contribute this. Edit: I am surprised and heartened that this has been shared so widely! People have asked me to credential myself, so to that end, I am a doctoral level Psychologist in NYS with a Psy.D. in the specialities of School and Clinical Psychology. MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS TIPS FOR QUARANTINE 1. Stick to a routine. Go to sleep and wake up at a reasonable time, write a schedule that is varied and includes time for work as well as self-care. 2. Dress for the social life you want, not the social life you have. Get showered and dressed in comfortable clothes, wash your face, brush your teeth. Take the time to do a bath or a facial. Put on some bright colors. It is amazing how our dress can impact our mood. 3. Get out at least once a day, for at least thirty minutes. If you are concerned of contact, try first thing in the morning, or later in the evening, and try less traveled streets and avenues. If you are high risk or living with those who are high risk, open the windows and blast the fan. It is amazing how much fresh air can do for spirits. 4. Find some time to move each day, again daily for at least thirty minutes. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable going outside, there are many YouTube videos that offer free movement classes, and if all else fails, turn on the music and have a dance party! 5. Reach out to others, you guessed it, at least once daily for thirty minutes. Try to do FaceTime, Skype, phone calls, texting\u2014connect with other people to seek and provide support. Don\u2019t forget to do this for your children as well. Set up virtual playdates with friends daily via FaceTime, Facebook Messenger Kids, Zoom, etc\u2014your kids miss their friends, too! 6. Stay hydrated and eat well. This one may seem obvious, but stress and eating often don\u2019t mix well, and we find ourselves over-indulging, forgetting to eat, and avoiding food. Drink plenty of water, eat some good and nutritious foods, and challenge yourself to learn how to cook something new! 7. Develop a self-care toolkit. This can look different for everyone. A lot of successful self-care strategies involve a sensory component (seven senses: touch, taste, sight, hearing, smell, vestibular (movement) and proprioceptive (comforting pressure). An idea for each: a soft blanket or stuffed animal, a hot chocolate, photos of vacations, comforting music, lavender or eucalyptus oil, a small swing or rocking chair, a weighted blanket. A journal, an inspirational book, or a mandala coloring book is wonderful, bubbles to blow or blowing watercolor on paper through a straw are visually appealing as well as work on controlled breath. Mint gum, Listerine strips, ginger ale, frozen Starburst, ice packs, and cold are also good for anxiety regulation. For children, it is great to help them create a self-regulation comfort box (often a shoe-box or bin they can decorate) that they can use on the ready for first-aid when overwhelmed. 8. Spend extra time playing with children. Children will rarely communicate how they are feeling, but will often make a bid for attention and communication through play. Don\u2019t be surprised to see therapeutic themes of illness, doctor visits, and isolation play through. Understand that play is cathartic and helpful for children\u2014it is how they process their world and problem solve, and there\u2019s a lot they are seeing and experiencing in the now. 9. Give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and a wide berth. A lot of cooped up time can bring out the worst in everyone. Each person will have moments when they will not be at their best. It is important to move with grace through blowups, to not show up to every argument you are invited to, and to not hold grudges and continue disagreements. Everyone is doing the best they can to make it through this. 10. Everyone find their own retreat space. Space is at a premium, particularly with city living. It is important that people think through their own separate space for work and for relaxation. For children, help them identify a place where they can go to retreat when stressed. You can make this place cozy by using blankets, pillows, cushions, scarves, beanbags, tents, and \u201cforts\u201d. It is good to know that even when we are on top of each other, we have our own special place to go to be alone. 11. Expect behavioral issues in children, and respond gently. We are all struggling with disruption in routine, none more than children, who rely on routines constructed by others to make them feel safe and to know what comes next. Expect increased anxiety, worries and fears, nightmares, difficulty separating or sleeping, testing limits, and meltdowns. Do not introduce major behavioral plans or consequences at this time\u2014hold stable and focus on emotional connection. 12. Focus on safety and attachment. We are going to be living for a bit with the unprecedented demand of meeting all work deadlines, homeschooling children, running a sterile household, and making a whole lot of entertainment in confinement. We can get wrapped up in meeting expectations in all domains, but we must remember that these are scary and unpredictable times for children. Focus on strengthening the connection through time spent following their lead, through physical touch, through play, through therapeutic books, and via verbal reassurances that you will be there for them in this time. 13. Lower expectations and practice radical self-acceptance. This idea is connected with #12. We are doing too many things in this moment, under fear and stress. This does not make a formula for excellence. Instead, give yourself what psychologists call \u201cradical self acceptance\u201d: accepting everything about yourself, your current situation, and your life without question, blame, or pushback. You cannot fail at this\u2014there is no roadmap, no precedent for this, and we are all truly doing the best we can in an impossible situation. 14. Limit social media and COVID conversation, especially around children. One can find tons of information on COVID-19 to consume, and it changes minute to minute. The information is often sensationalized, negatively skewed, and alarmist. Find a few trusted sources that you can check in with consistently, limit it to a few times a day, and set a time limit for yourself on how much you consume (again 30 minutes tops, 2-3 times daily). Keep news and alarming conversations out of earshot from children\u2014they see and hear everything, and can become very frightened by what they hear. 15. Notice the good in the world, the helpers. There is a lot of scary, negative, and overwhelming information to take in regarding this pandemic. There are also a ton of stories of people sacrificing, donating, and supporting one another in miraculous ways. It is important to counter-balance the heavy information with the hopeful information. 16. Help others. Find ways, big and small, to give back to others. Support restaurants, offer to grocery shop, check in with elderly neighbors, write psychological wellness tips for others\u2014helping others gives us a sense of agency when things seem out of control. 17. Find something you can control, and control the heck out of it. In moments of big uncertainty and overwhelm, control your little corner of the world. Organize your bookshelf, purge your closet, put together that furniture, group your toys. It helps to anchor and ground us when the bigger things are chaotic. 18. Find a long-term project to dive into. Now is the time to learn how to play the keyboard, put together a huge jigsaw puzzle, start a 15 hour game of Risk, paint a picture, read the Harry Potter series, binge watch an 8-season show, crochet a blanket, solve a Rubix cube, or develop a new town in Animal Crossing. Find something that will keep you busy, distracted, and engaged to take breaks from what is going on in the outside world. 19. Engage in repetitive movements and left-right movements. Research has shown that repetitive movement (knitting, coloring, painting, clay sculpting, jump roping etc) especially left-right movement (running, drumming, skating, hopping) can be effective at self-soothing and maintaining self-regulation in moments of distress. 20. Find an expressive art and go for it. Our emotional brain is very receptive to the creative arts, and it is a direct portal for release of feeling. Find something that is creative (sculpting, drawing, dancing, music, singing, playing) and give it your all. See how relieved you can feel. It is a very effective way of helping kids to emote and communicate as well! 21. Find lightness and humor in each day. There is a lot to be worried about, and with good reason. Counterbalance this heaviness with something funny each day: cat videos on YouTube, a stand-up show on Netflix, a funny movie\u2014we all need a little comedic relief in our day, every day. 22. Reach out for help\u2014your team is there for you. If you have a therapist or psychiatrist, they are available to you, even at a distance. Keep up your medications and your therapy sessions the best you can. If you are having difficulty coping, seek out help for the first time. There are mental health people on the ready to help you through this crisis. Your children\u2019s teachers and related service providers will do anything within their power to help, especially for those parents tasked with the difficult task of being a whole treatment team to their child with special challenges. Seek support groups of fellow home-schoolers, parents, and neighbors to feel connected. There is help and support out there, any time of the day\u2014although we are physically distant, we can always connect virtually. 23. \u201cChunk\u201d your quarantine, take it moment by moment. We have no road map for this. We don\u2019t know what this will look like in 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month from now. Often, when I work with patients who have anxiety around overwhelming issues, I suggest that they engage in a strategy called \u201cchunking\u201d\u2014focusing on whatever bite-sized piece of a challenge that feels manageable. Whether that be 5 minutes, a day, or a week at a time\u2014find what feels doable for you, and set a time stamp for how far ahead in the future you will let yourself worry. Take each chunk one at a time, and move through stress in pieces. 24. Remind yourself daily that this is temporary. It seems in the midst of this quarantine that it will never end. It is terrifying to think of the road stretching ahead of us. Please take time to remind yourself that although this is very scary and difficult, and will go on for an undetermined amount of time, it is a season of life and it will pass. We will return to feeing free, safe, busy, and connected in the days ahead. 25. Find the lesson. This whole crisis can seem sad, senseless, and at times, avoidable. When psychologists work with trauma, a key feature to helping someone work through said trauma is to help them find their agency, the potential positive outcomes they can effect, the meaning and construction that can come out of destruction. What can each of us learn here, in big and small ways, from this crisis? What needs to change in ourselves, our homes, our communities, our nation, and our world?",

Transgender Activists Question the Movement\u2019s Confrontational Approach (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/us/politics/transgender-activists-rights.html) Facing diminishing public support, some activists say all-or-nothing tactics are not working. \u201cWe have to make it OK for someone to change their minds.\u201d Nov. 26, 2024 By Jeremy W. Peters (https://www.nytimes.com/by/jeremy-w-peters) ; Jeremy Peters has written about the evolution of the L.G.B.T.Q. movement for more than a decade. To get on the wrong side of transgender activists is often to endure their unsparing criticism. After a Democratic congressman defended parents who expressed concern about transgender athletes competing against their young daughters, a local party official and ally compared (https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/13/metro/seth-moulton-democrats-transgender-backlash-election-challenge-massachusetts/?event=event12) him to a Nazi \u201ccooperator\u201d and a group called \u201cNeighbors Against Hate\u201d organized (https://abc3340.com/news/nation-world/protesters-descend-on-democratic-congressmans-office-over-transgender-comments-seth-moulton-salem-massachusetts-lgbt-rights-salem-city-councilor-elect-kyle-davis) a protest outside his office. When J.K. Rowling said (https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/) that denying any relationship between sex and biology was \u201cdeeply misogynistic and regressive,\u201d a prominent L.G.B.T.Q. group accused (https://www.hrc.org/news/hrc-president-alphonso-david-responds-to-j-k-rowlings-latest-transphobic-b) her of betraying \u201creal feminism.\u201d A few angry critics posted videos of themselves burning her books. When the Biden administration convened a call with L.G.B.T.Q. allies last year to discuss new limits (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/us/transgender-athletes-title-ix-biden-adminstration.html) on the participation of transgender student athletes, one activist fumed on the call that the administration would be complicit in \u201cgenocide\u201d of transgender youth, according to two people with knowledge of the incident. Now, some activists say it is time to rethink and recalibrate their confrontational ways, and are pushing back against the more all-or-nothing voices in their coalition. \u201cWe have to make it OK for someone to change their minds,\u201d said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, executive director of Advocates for Transgender Equality. \u201cWe cannot vilify them for not being on our side. No one wants to join that team.\u201d They cite tactics, especially on social media, that became routine for devoted backers of the movement: Attempts to police language, such as excising the words \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d from discussions of pregnancy and abortion; decrying the misidentification of a transgender person as violence; insisting that everyone declare whether they prefer to be referred to as he, she or other pronouns. Some L.G.B.T.Q. activists have put pressure on liberal candidates for office to take positions that align with theirs \u2014 which can backfire. Republicans pummeled Vice President Kamala Harris in ads this year over the answers she gave on a 2019 questionnaire (https://www.aclu.org/documents/aclu-rights-for-all-candidate-questionnaire-2019) from the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that has been active in the transgender cause. The questionnaire asked Ms. Harris to commit to ensuring that transgender people in federal custody, \u201cincluding those in prison and immigration detention,\u201d could receive gender-transition surgery. Mr. Heng-Lehtinen, 38, who grew up in a prominent Republican family in Florida and came out to them as transgender after college, said that as painful as Mr. Trump\u2019s election may be for transgender people, their movement should see the benefit in treating skeptics less like enemies and more like future allies. \u201cNo one wants to feel stupid or condescended to,\u201d Mr. Heng-Lehtinen said. This soul-searching comes at a time when Democrats are engaging (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/newsom-california-counties-trump.html) in a broader discussion (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/politics/harris-trump-democrats-election.html) of how their efforts to advance social and racial justice in recent years may have appeared to be too judgmental and helped contribute to the perception that their party had lost its understanding of the problems Americans want politicians to prioritize. Republicans spent tens of millions of dollars on ads that accused Democrats of \u201cwokeness\u201d and capitalized on the unfamiliarity most Americans have with transgender people\u2019s lives, using hyperbole and distortions that often created false impressions of schoolhouse indoctrination and locker rooms full of predators. L.G.B.T.Q. activists are confronting a political landscape that has grown more hostile. More than two dozen states now limit access to transition medical treatment. Last week, House Republicans vowed (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/mike-johnson-transgender-women-ban-capitol-bathrooms.html) to bar transgender women from using women\u2019s restrooms in the Capitol, a not-so-subtle affront to Sarah McBride of Delaware, who this month became the first transgender person elected to Congress. Ms. McBride \u2014 who has insisted (https://x.com/SarahEMcBride/status/1858299359349076024) that she is a voice for all her constituents, and \u201cnot a spokesperson for a movement\u201d \u2014 said that she would follow House rules even if she disagreed with them. It is that kind of targeting from conservatives \u2014 which transgender people say is deeply personal and far too common \u2014 that makes many activists wary of relying on a gentler, more traditional political approach. Some of them saw avoidance in Ms. McBride\u2019s matter-of-fact response, and accused her of capitulating to the right. If they seem impatient, activists say, it is because they are. \u201cWhat we\u2019re facing is fundamental unfairness \u2014 and that is not coming from people who are interested in compromise and open debate,\u201d said Gillian Branstetter, a communications strategist with the American Civil Liberties Union who works on transgender advocacy. \u201cThese are people who are threatened by trans people\u2019s very existence. And, more importantly, they\u2019re trying to scapegoat us.\u201d The A.C.L.U. noted in a statement, for instance, that its 2019 questionnaire asked 19 questions on a range of subjects because voters needed to be able to \u201cdraw meaningful policy distinctions among the crowded field.\u201d Democrats are experiencing their own disillusionment with the national conversation over transgender rights, a debate that they say can sound dogmatic and intolerant. \u201cHere we are calling Republicans weird, and we\u2019re the party that makes people put pronouns in their email signature,\u201d said Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Democrat who ignited fury (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/us/politics/democrats-transgender-rights-moulton.html) and protests at his office after he expressed concern that transgender athletes could have an unfair advantage or hurt other athletes. Even so, he added, Democrats \u2014 and most Americans, for that matter \u2014 still want to protect transgender people from discrimination. \u201cHaving reasonable restrictions for safety and competitive fairness in sports seems like, well, it\u2019s very empirically a majority opinion,\u201d Mr. Moulton said. \u201cBut should we take civil rights away from trans people, so they can just get fired for being who they are? No.\u201d Transgender rights were not top of mind for most voters on Election Day. According to Gallup (https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx) , voters who were asked how important each of 22 national issues were in their voting decisions ranked transgender rights lowest. The public does not appear to be growing more empathetic to the transgender cause. Fewer (https://www.prri.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PRRI-Oct-2024-AVS-Draft_B.pdf) Americans today than two years ago say they support some of the rights that L.G.B.T.Q. activists have pushed for, like allowing children to undergo gender transition treatment, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. And multiple (https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-transgender-rights-lgbtq-donald-trump-3bb3ace81ff32b6dec382b486ec6a772) recent polls (https://www.prri.org/research/threats-to-american-democracy-ahead-of-an-unprecedented-presidential-election/) have found that a considerable majority of Americans believe advocacy for transgender rights has gone \u201ctoo far.\u201d This trend pains many longtime L.G.B.T.Q. activists, many of whom worked on the decades-long campaign to win widespread acceptance for gay and lesbian people. In interviews, some activists stressed that it was important to see the big picture: The L.G.B.T.Q. movement is working through a difficult pivot, trying to apply lessons from the same-sex marriage campaign to the newer fight for transgender equality. Evan Wolfson, founder of the pro-same-sex marriage group Freedom to Marry, said he and other activists learned that a key to victory in the long term was accepting small, less rewarding gains at first, like civil unions. \u201cWe always said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to ask for civil unions. But we\u2019ll take it as a mechanism to move people along\u2019,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said. He received criticism from all sides, with some gay rights activists dismissing civil unions as empty half-measures and many Democrats blaming electoral losses on the perception that the party was pushing same-sex marriage on a reluctant country. Eventually, the debate over legalizing civil unions in the 1990s evolved into dialogue over full marriage rights by the 2000s, culminating in the next decade with the Supreme Court decision establishing (https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html) same-sex marriage as a constitutional right. The discussion about transgender rights is \u201cstill a relatively new one \u2014 and a growing one,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said. \u201cThat conversation takes time.\u201d Mara Keisling, an activist who founded the National Center for Transgender Equality in 2002, remembered an adage she used 20 years ago about legislative priorities: \u201cYou can\u2019t say \u2018Don\u2019t fire them\u2019 until you can say \u2018Don\u2019t kill them\u2019\u201d \u2014 meaning that advocates should focus first on measures that reinforced the fundamental humanity of transgender people, such as hate-crime protections. Then, she said, you can push more effectively for laws about discrimination. Ms. Keisling said too many activists today are distracted by counterproductive debates \u2014 boycotting Ms. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter series, for example, and insisting that there are no reasonable objections to allowing transgender women into high-level sports. Ms. Keisling noted that L.G.B.T.Q. activists lost credibility with many Americans once they started accusing people of bigotry over sports. \u201cWe looked unreasonable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be talking about the 7-year-old who just wants to play soccer with her friends.\u201d (Ms. Keisling insists she is hardly na\u00efve about the animosity from the right; it has been directed at her personally. Her image was used in one of the Trump campaign ads that attacked Democrats over transgender rights this year.) Mr. Heng-Lehtinen of Advocates for Transgender Equality said he agreed that the movement needed a more persuasive message on sports. School districts and athletics associations, he said, have long been dealing with the issue of transgender athletes. The matter should be left to them, and not to the whims of Republican legislators, he added. Image \u201cI don\u2019t think we are best served by imposing a one-size-fits-all solution,\u201d he said, adding that \u201csweeping and crude\u201d bans on transgender athletes are just that. Advocates said their research had found that the most effective messaging takes into account that most Americans do not know a lot about life as a transgender person, and reinforces the basic idea that transgender people want what everyone else wants: fairness, respect and love. \u201cIt is our job to break the misinformation down and to say compassionately, \u2018It\u2019s perfectly understandable that you have questions,\u2019\u201d Mr. Heng-Lehtinen said. Put more directly, he added, \u201cThat\u2019s not yelling at someone.\u201d",
