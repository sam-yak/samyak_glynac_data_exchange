A box will pop up where you will check the deliverables you wish to add to your invoice. After selecting your deliverables, select \u201cProceed\u201d. An Invoice is then created.

    "message": "Hi Team, Please make sure to attend one of the two meeting options that will cover Compass Invoicing OPTION #1: Monday, March 21st at 10a CST OPTION #2: Wednesday, March 23rd at 11a CST Some of you have asked for info on what deliverables should/should not be added to Compass. Here are some guidelines to assist you: - If your open/active SOWs contain deliverables that HAVE been both delivered AND invoiced in prior years (prior to 2022) = You DO NOT need to add those deliverables to Compass - However, IF you choose to add deliverables that have been both delivered and invoiced in prior years, you must create an Invoice in Compass & mark the Accounting Status as \u201cLegacy Invoice\u201d - To create the invoice, from the Quote page select \u201cUse data on quote to Create Invoice.\u201d From here, you will choose \u201cSelect lines for partial invoicing.\u201d This will allow you to select only the deliverables that you need to invoice for. A box will pop up where you will check the deliverables you wish to add to your invoice. After selecting your deliverables, select \u201cProceed\u201d. An Invoice is then created. Since this is a \u201cdummy\u201d invoice, there is no need to edit any information. However, you must select \u201cLegacy Invoice\u201d from the Accounting Status and hit Save. Once you return to your Quote, you will see your invoice under \u201cInvoices.\u201d - For already invoiced items, you can group them all into 1 deliverable if easier (EX: put 100 IDIs on one line or 5 UTBEs on one line) - If your open/active SOWs contain deliverables that HAVE been invoiced but HAVE NOT been delivered = You MUST add deliverables to Compass - You must also create a \u201cPrepayment Invoice\u201d in Compass & mark the Accounting Status as \u201cLegacy Invoice\u201d - To create the prepayment invoice, from the Quote page select \u201cUse date on quote to Create Prepayment Invoice.\u201d From here, you will choose \u201cSelect lines for partial invoicing.\u201d This will allow you to select on the deliverables that you have pre-invoiced for. You can also choose to pre-invoice a percentage of all deliverables. After making your selection, select \u201cProceed.\u201d An Invoice is then created. Since this is a \u201cdummy\u201d invoice, there is no need to edit any information. However, you must select \u201cLegacy Invoice\u201d from the Accounting Status and hit Save. Once you return to your Quote, you will see your invoice under \u201cPrepayment Invoices.\u201d - For already invoiced items, you can group them all into 1 deliverable if easier - If your open/active SOWs contain deliverables that HAVE NOT been invoiced but HAVE been delivered = You MUST add deliverables to Compass",
